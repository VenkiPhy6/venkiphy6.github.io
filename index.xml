      <description><![CDATA[<p>I started this website with 3 goals in mind. They are, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to develop a writing practice.</li>
<li>I want to develop a visualization practice.</li>
<li>I want a CV website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, actually I lied. There is a 4th reason:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>I am taking a class where the professor wanted me to create a Github website for an assignment. This website will be my submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>But if 4 was my primary motive, I would&rsquo;ve finished this website creation in an hour or so. I ended up spending <em>(turns chair to look at the clock)</em>, about 7-8 hours, learning to play with Hugo and I am finally writing this post because I value the first 3 goals much more than the 4th one.</p>
<p>I especially value the first goal. While I have written before, I have not written consistently enough to hone my writing skills systematically. It has always been for one-off reasons like my Master&rsquo;s thesis or an assignment. I hope spending 7-8 hours and creating a website and publicly admitting that I really want to do this will be a good motivating factor to start developing a writing practice. In addition to that, since I am back in college now, I am learning new things every week which gives me a new topic to write about every week. So that reduces the friction further to start practicing.</p>
<p>One thing I am not sure about is in regards to the word I used earlier - <em>systematically</em>. I don&rsquo;t know how I will systematically get better at writing. In fact I am assuming that is something one can do. Since you are reading this, I hope you will stick around and read what I post to let me know what you think. A feedback loop seems like a good way to know if I am heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>Another method I have in mind is to note down problems I run into when I am trying to write and notice patterns in those problems. I am assuming that I can approach the writing practice like a computer scientist and reduce the skill of writing to certain classes of problems and then have algorithms in mind to attack those problems. It might be a fool&rsquo;s errand to attempt generalizing something as context specific as writing but I have to start somewhere. I might also be biased to think about writing like a computer scientist would, since the best writing advice I have gotten so far comes from a computer scientist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;&hellip; even if you have only 60 readers, it pays to spend an hour if by doing so you can save your average reader a minute.&quot;</em> &ndash; Edsger W. Dijkstra, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD13xx/EWD1300.html">EWD1300</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one rule I try to maintain, albeit with much difficulty and failing often, is that of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g-PAvTpmas">Computational kindness</a> (links to video). That has definitely helped me draft good emails with more of a focus on actions the reader needs to take rather than information which they can search when they need instead of reading every word. But I can&rsquo;t clearly see how to apply that idea to longer forms of writing when the whole point of the piece could be to convey information and not to call for action. I think the answer would be along the lines of &lsquo;Edit ruthlessly&rsquo;. But I am not entirely sure how to do that.</p>
<p>The second goal is to develop a visualization practice. I want to master Tableau. I have used Tableau before, but I have not mastered it. I believe I can tie up goals 1 and 2 together by writing with data visualizations interspersed. I am hoping to read the excellent book, Whole Numbers and Half Truths by Rukmini S, and replicate the visualizations available in that book as a practice exercise. We will see how that goes.</p>
<p>Atleast, goals 3 and 4 have been achieved (See my <a href="/about">About page</a>). I hope goals 1 and 2 will also be achieved to some extent. After all, to end my first post in this blog in an optimistic note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúHope‚Äù is the thing with feathers -</em></p>
<p><em>That perches in the soul -</em></p>
<p><em>And sings the tune without the words -</em></p>
<p><em>And never stops - at all -</em></p>
<p>&ndash; &ldquo;Hope&rsquo; is the thing with feathers, Emily Dickinson</p>
</blockquote>

      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="short-bio">Short bio</h1>
<p>Hi! I am Venkatesh (pronounced Venn-cut-aesh). Friends calls me Venki (pronounced Venn-key) and this website is the namesake of that nickname. I am currently a Master&rsquo;s student in <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/fact-sheets/epps/ms-social-data-analytics-and-research/">Social Data Analytics and Research at the University of Texas at Dallas</a>. I have ~2.6 years of work experience at a boutique analytics firm, consulting with Indian fashion retail giants as a data analyst. I am good at SQL, Python and advanced Excel. I have also worked with Bash (mostly awk), Google Apps Script, Git/Github and Hugo (this website is built with it). I am looking forward for a career in Data Analytics/Science, hopefully in an interesting domain. You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkateshutd/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/venkiphy6">Github</a> (where this website is hosted).</p>
<p>I am currently looking for internships for Summer 2023 (May 2023-Aug 2023). You can hit me up on LinkedIn if you have any leads.</p>

<h1 id="longer-bio">Longer bio</h1>
<p>I am a Tamizhan born and brought up in Chennai, India. I currently live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in TX, USA. Below is the story of how I went from Chennai to Mangalore to Bangalore and finally to Dallas - a journey from the Indian South to the American South!</p>
<p>In 2012-13, when I was in high school, I was invited to attend the <a href="https://online-inspire.gov.in/Account/INSPIREProgramme">INSPIRE Science camp</a> which motivated me to pursue a degree in Physics in college and I graduated from NIT Karnataka, Mangalore, India with a Master&rsquo;s degree in 2019. Towards the end of that degree, I discovered my love for Linear Algebra and decided to switch paths to Data Analytics. I joined Cartesian Consulting as an Analyst in Bangalore, India and worked there for 2 years and 8 months. I was good at work and got a promotion to Senior Analyst while winning multiple awards for my performance. But my aspiration to be an <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruist</a>, pushed me to explore ways to utilize my data analytics skills in a more meaningful domain. So alongside my work at Cartesian, I began my exploration with a certificate course in technology policy at a local think tank, <a href="https://takshashila.org.in/">The Takshashila Institution</a>, and fell in love with the policy domain. This newborn interest led me to apply to the Social Data Analytics course of the School of Economics, Political and Policy Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas. I was delighted to get admitted to the program, decided to take a short break while pursuing another certificate at The Takshashila Institution, this time in Advanced Public Policy, and then moved to Dallas in July 2022. In Sep 2022, I created this website.</p>
<p>That has been my life so far. Fingers crossed for the adventures to come! üòä</p>
