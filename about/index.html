<p>Hi! I am Venkatesh (pronounced Venn-cut-aesh). Friends calls me Venki (pronounced Venn-key) and this website is the namesake of that nickname. I am currently a Master&rsquo;s student in <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/fact-sheets/epps/ms-social-data-analytics-and-research/">Social Data Analytics and Research at the University of Texas at Dallas</a>. I have ~2.6 years of work experience at a boutique analytics firm, consulting with Indian fashion retail giants as a data analyst. I am good at SQL, Python and advanced Excel. I have also worked with Bash (mostly awk), Google Apps Script, Git/Github and Hugo (this website is built with it). I am looking forward for a career in Data Analytics/Science, hopefully in an interesting domain. You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkateshutd/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/venkiphy6">Github</a> (where this website is hosted).</p>
<p>I am currently looking for internships for Summer 2023 (May 2023-Aug 2023). You can hit me up on LinkedIn if you have any leads.</p>

<h1 id="longer-bio">Longer bio</h1>
<p>I am a Tamizhan born and brought up in Chennai, India. I currently live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in TX, USA. Below is the story of how I went from Chennai to Mangalore to Bangalore and finally to Dallas - a journey from the Indian South to the American South!</p>
<p>In 2012-13, when I was in high school, I was invited to attend the <a href="https://online-inspire.gov.in/Account/INSPIREProgramme">INSPIRE Science camp</a> which motivated me to pursue a degree in Physics in college and I graduated from NIT Karnataka, Mangalore, India with a Master&rsquo;s degree in 2019. Towards the end of that degree, I discovered my love for Linear Algebra and decided to switch paths to Data Analytics. I joined Cartesian Consulting as an Analyst in Bangalore, India and worked there for 2 years and 8 months. I was good at work and got a promotion to Senior Analyst while winning multiple awards for my performance. But my aspiration to be an <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruist</a>, pushed me to explore ways to utilize my data analytics skills in a more meaningful domain. So alongside my work at Cartesian, I began my exploration with a certificate course in technology policy at a local think tank, <a href="https://takshashila.org.in/">The Takshashila Institution</a>, and fell in love with the policy domain. This newborn interest led me to apply to the Social Data Analytics course of the School of Economics, Political and Policy Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas. I was delighted to get admitted to the program, decided to take a short break while pursuing another certificate at The Takshashila Institution, this time in Advanced Public Policy, and then moved to Dallas in July 2022. In Sep 2022, I created this website.</p>
<p>That has been my life so far. Fingers crossed for the adventures to come! üòä</p>
