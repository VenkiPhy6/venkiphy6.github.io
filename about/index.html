<p>I am an early-stage Doctoral student in <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/fact-sheets/epps/phd-public-policy-and-political-economy/">Public Policy and Political Economy</a> at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am looking forward for a career where I can leverage my quantitative and communication skills to create and advocate for evidence-dependent policy. üî¢‚ûïüí¨üü∞üèõÔ∏è</p>
<p>I blend hard and soft skills with experience in all 3 regimes of statistical analysis - descriptive, predictive and causal - using data analysis tools like Python, R, STATA, SQL, and advanced Excel alongside an understanding of stakeholder management, Bardach&rsquo;s eighfold path to policymaking and practice in writing policy papers and talking points memos.</p>
<p>I have a quantitative background, thanks to a degree in Physics‚öõÔ∏è and industry experience as a data analystüìä. This, blended with an interest in policy, led me to pursue my current doctoral degreeüéì in <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/fact-sheets/epps/phd-public-policy-and-political-economy/">PPPE</a> at UTD. My knowledge of policy comes from this degree and my internship at the Center for Global Developmentüåç alongside the Graduate Archer Fellowship in DC. I also hold a certification in Technology Policyü§ñ from the Takshashila Institution which kindled my interests in public policy.</p>

<h1 id="longer-bio">Longer bio</h1>
<p>I am Venkatesh (pronounced Venn-cut-aesh). Friends calls me Venki (pronounced Venn-key) and this website is the namesake of that nickname. I am a Tamizhan born and brought up in Chennai, India. I currently live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in TX, USA. Below is the story of how I went from Chennai to Mangalore to Bangalore and finally to Dallas - a journey from the Indian South to the American South!</p>
<p>In 2012-13, when I was a high schooler in Chennai, I was invited to attend the <a href="https://online-inspire.gov.in/Account/INSPIREProgramme">INSPIRE Science camp</a> which motivated me to pursue a degree in Physics in college and I graduated from NIT Karnataka, Mangalore, India with a Master&rsquo;s degree in 2019. Towards the end of that degree, I discovered my love for Linear Algebra and decided to switch paths to Data Analytics. I joined Cartesian Consulting as an Analyst in Bangalore, India and worked there for 2 years and 8 months. I was good at work and got a promotion to Senior Analyst while winning multiple awards for my performance. But my aspirations to have a more meaningful social impact, pushed me to explore ways to utilize my data analytics skills in other domains. So alongside my work at Cartesian, I began my exploration with a certificate course in technology policy at The Takshashila Institution, and fell in love with the policy domain. This newborn interest led me to apply to the Social Data Analytics course of the School of Economics, Political and Policy Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas. I was delighted to get admitted to the program, decided to take a short break while pursuing another certificate at The Takshashila Institution, this time in Advanced Public Policy, and then moved to Dallas in July 2022. In Sep 2022, I created this website.</p>
<p>During my first year at UTD I took courses on Research Design, and was encouraged by professors to consider pursuing a PhD given my performance in the courses. After a lot of introspection and counsel from friends, I took the leap and got accepted into the PhD in Public Policy and Political Economy program starting August 2023. The summer before starting this program (May-July 2023) I was also awarded the Graduate Archer fellowship and spent living, learning and working in Washington D.C. which further emboldened my resolve to go for the PhD.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for the adventures to come! üòä</p>
